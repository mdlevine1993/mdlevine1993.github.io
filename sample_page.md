## About Me

**My background:** I'm a graduate student at Temple University pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics. I also work full-time as a data analyst for Retail Insights, LLC, a retail data analytics company, where I work as an onsite consultant to AmerisourceBergen's Consumer Products team. 

I'm skilled in a number of data science tools and methods, like Excel and VBA; Tableau; R; SQL; linear, multiple, logistic and multinomial regression; ANOVA; machine learning, including random forests; and clustering and segmentation.

Outside of the office, I love rock climbing, hiking and running. I'm a big fan of the New York Jets (despite our historically less-than-stellar track record) and enjoy the little things in life. I love craft beer, comedy shows, and recently picked up an appreciation for traveling. I've been to 24 US states and Washington DC, Mexico, Israel, Sierra Leone, and (soon) Puerto Rico.
